# odin-recipes

This is a recipe book written in HTML for the Odin Project; see here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.
The requirements of this project is to create a recipe index in HTML only. This project helped me learn how to use git and github, how to write HTML, how to organize directories for a webpage, and how to access files in those directories to be displayed in HTML.

Hope you enjoy!
