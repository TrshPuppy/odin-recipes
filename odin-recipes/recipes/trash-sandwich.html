        <h5> Trash Puppy's Trash Sandwich is what kept him strong and his stomach full in the streets! </h5>
        <h4>
            <p>
                Living in the streets as a trash puppy is ruff! Food is hard to come by
                and it usually isn't very appetizing. That's why Trash Puppy wants to share
                his favorite home-prepared meal so other trash puppies and kitties like
                him can do more than just survive; they can thrive!
            </p>
            <p>
                This recipe was written to accomodate for both fortunate and unfortunate luck. So, whether you catch the fattest,
                juiciest rat, or can only find the scrawniest dead bird, you'll be able to make at least something from nothing!

                <ul>
                    <li> 1, but preferably 2, pieces of dry newspaper. </li>
                    <li> 1 dead rat, the fresher the better! Self-caught or found, doesn't matter. </li>
                    <li> 1 slice leftover cheese OR congealed milk if cheese is unavailable. </li>
                    <li> 1 banana peel as filler (IMPORTANT!). </li>
                </ul>

        <h2> Directions: </h2>
        <h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Find some newspaper. Look for the dryest newspaper you can find w/ the 
                        most intact leaflets. But don't spend all day looking, or you will spend more
                        precious energy than this sandwhich can replace. If you have to settle for 1
                        soggy leaflet, then so be it!
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> Hunt down a nice juicy rat. The fatter the better! But, if you've spent more than 
                        a few hours hunting and aren't successful, any dead carcass will do. Make sure you
                        give it a good sniff! You can't risk getting sick b/c of some rotting meat! Better to
                        starve for a night and try again tomorrow.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> Find some left over cheese slices, (bonus: a rat or mouse may be near by!)
                        If you can't find cheese, congealed milk will work because it's basically cheese
                        anyway. Remember though, getting sick for a week is worse than starving for a night!
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> Find a banana peel. This should be the easiest to come by and the quality doesn't matter. If 
                        you are fortunate enough to come across many banana peels, than choose the largest and freshest!
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> Place the rat/carcass, cheese/congealed milk, and banana peel in between the leaflets of
                        newspaper.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> Give the sandwhich one last good sniff and if you don't smell any harmful pathogens or germs
                        then dig in!
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li> After a long day of scrounging in dumpsters and alleys for food, fall asleep in your favorite cardboard
                        box with a stomach that is full and happy!
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                </ol>
