        <h5> Pho is a popular Vietnamese noodle soup that commonly consists of rice noodles, beef or chicken, herbs, and various vegetables. </h5>
        <p></p>
        <h4>
            <p> 
                There are few things more delicious than a mess of rice noodles in a rich, umami-dominant, 
                intensely beefy broth. Vietnamese pho is a classic dish served all over the world, from fancy restraunts to home kitchens.
                Part of what makes this meal so popular is that you can serve the same pot for several days and it gets better w/ every serving!
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite popular belief, pho is relatively easy to make and allows for a lot of possibilities and fresh takes. So, whether you
                want something hardy to get you over that hang over, or a friend/family member is sick and could use some soul-warming food,
                Pho has got your back!

                    <li> Add charred onions, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, coriander, fish sauce, sugar and 1 tbsp of salt. Bring to boil
                        then reduce heat and let simmer. Skim broth occasionally to remove congealed fat. Let simmer for about 1.5 - 2 hours.
                    </li>

                        sauce/salt/sugar if flavor is too mild. Continue to skim broth of excess fat on surface and discard. Try to keep broth at 
                        around 4 quarts.

                    <p></p>
