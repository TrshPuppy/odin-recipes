            <p>
                Starting around Halloween, have you ever noticed the cans of Libby's 100% pure pumpkin suddenly proliferating in your local grocery store?
                Maybe you also noticed more cans of Nestle Carnation evaporated milk? Well, that's because these two go together like peanut butter and jelly
                when it comes to making pumpkin pie!
            </p>
            <p> 
                The Libby's Famous Pumpkin Pie recipe can be found on the labels of Libby's 100% pure pumpkin cans, and dates back to 1950! It is one
                of the easiest recipes you can find for pumpkin pie and the resulting pie is almost always fantastic. So, if you feel like making
                some pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, or maybe it's the middle of June and PSL season just can't get here fast enough, grab yourself a can 
                or follow this recipe (they're exactly the same), and get ready to stuff your face with delicious, fluffy pie!
